### Simulation Metadata

- Holds input data for AxiSEM3D simulations. 
- `model_gen.py` is used to generate NetCDF file for scattering
  simulations. It is an older version of the scripts that can 
  be found in [AxiSEM-Shapes](https://github.com/williameaton/axisem3d-shapes). 
- Note that the `model_gen.py` script has variables from lines 407 onwards to 
  alter the model generated.
